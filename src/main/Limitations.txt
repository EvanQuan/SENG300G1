Limitations:
1. Calling static methods and static fields from another class of the same package will not increment the reference counter for the 
    declaring class. 
    Due to the fact that these are parsed as VariableDeclarationFragments nodes, and their type informations are stored under 
    Initializer as a QualifiedName. As local static fields and methods are parsed in the same manner, both localStaticField and 
    Foo.staticField will increment their own declaring class's counters. (Not what we want)

String i = localStaticField
string j = localStaticMethod()
String x = Foo.staticField
String y = Foo.staticMethod()
